Description: This package provides tools to analyze bird migration data using satellite tracking records on Movebank (https://www.movebank.org). The current version includes 12 functions. The first function format.data() imports Movebank data, adds variables (Year, Month, Day, Day_fine, Dist, Dist2, Speed_ave, Theta, and Delta_th ). Day_fine is a continuous variable of Julian Day with accurate level up to minute. Dist and Dist2 are two distance variables, which are Euclidian distance between two adjacent points. Speed_ave is the minimum speed between the two points (the movement trajectory should be tortuous but I use a straight line to represent it). Theta is the moving direction, and Delta_th is the changes in moving direction. Other functions calculate daily movement distance (dist.annual) and annual movement distance (dist.annual), sum tracking durations (duration), estimate migration starting day (mig.day) and time (mig.hour), locate nest sites (nest.locating), and plot breeding and wintering areas (plot.breeding.wintering), plot movement trajectories (plot.traj), plot tracking duration (plot.track.duration), plot movement direction in a year (plot.direction), and plot daily movement distance (plot.daily.dict).
