Description: This package provides tools to analyze bird migration data, and it can use satellite tracking data 
  on Movebank (https://www.movebank.org). The current version includes 13 functions. The first function format.data() 
  imports Movebank data, adds variables (Year, Month, Day, Day_fine, Dist, Dist2, Speed, Direction and Redirect). 
  Day_fine is a continuous variable of Julian Day with accurate level up to minute. Dist and Dist2 are two distance 
  variables, which are Euclidian distance between two adjacent points. Speed is the minimum speed between the two 
  points (the movement trajectory should be tortuous but I use a straight line to represent it). Direction is 
  the moving direction calculated from every two adjacent points, and Redirect is the changes in moving direction. 
  Other functions calculate daily movement distance (dist_annual) and annual movement distance (dist_annual), 
  sum tracking durations (duration), estimate migration starting day (mig_day) and time (mig_hour), locate nest 
  sites (nest_locating), and plot breeding and wintering areas (plot_breeding_wintering), plot movement 
  trajectories (plot_traj), plot tracking duration (plot_track_duration), plot movement direction in a year 
  (plot_direction), and plot daily movement distance (plot_daily_dict).
