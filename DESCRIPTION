Description: This package provides tools to analyze animal migration data, and it was designed to use satellite tracking data on Movebank (https://www.movebank.org). The current version includes 14 functions. The function HOSDM() is to run Hetero-occurrence Species Distribution Models (HOSDMs), which are individual-based species distribution models designed to differentiate between various occurrence types with the aim of enhancing model performance. HOSDMs are specifically designed for using time-series satellite telemetry data.
